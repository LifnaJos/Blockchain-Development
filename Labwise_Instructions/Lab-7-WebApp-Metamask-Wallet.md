Lab - 7:			Experiment  No: 7		    Dated: 4th week of September 2023

AIM: To develop a blockchain-powered web application using Solidity programming language on Remix IDE and embedding Metamask Wallet

Lab Objectives: To understand and apply the concepts of keys, wallets.
Lab Outcomes (LO):  To create Gateway to Blockchain Apps.(LO5)

Task to be performed: 			[Follow the GitHub repository for the experiment]
Set Up MetaMask:
Install MetaMask
Create or Import an Account: 
Fund Your Wallet :  Sepolia Testnet (0.5 ETH per day) / RSK Testnet  (0.05 RBTC per day)
Connect the Sepolia Testnet  / RSK Testnet to Remix IDE       
Create a Simple Solidity Smart Contract based on the MiniPoject chosen
Compile and Deploy the Smart Contract.
Check the transaction details on the RSK Explorer
Interact with the smart contract 
Instructions : (Prepare for viva for the following topics)
What is a Metamask?
What is a test net?
List the steps to connect a Metamask with a Remix IDE for performing transactions.

Outcome :  
Understood the steps for embedding the Metamask wallet with Remix IDE and perform transactions
Successfully performed the transactions on the Remix IDE via the account from Metamask Wallet
Prepare a document with the Aim, Tasks performed, Program, Output, and Conclusion.
Submit the hard copy  by the 5th week of September 2023

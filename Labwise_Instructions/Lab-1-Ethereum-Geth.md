# Experiment  No - 1	: Set up an private Ethereum blockchain for development and testing purposes. 
* Date of Preparation : 3rd & 4th week of July
* Date of Submission : 1st week of August
* Lab Objectives: To build and test a Blockchain using Ethereum in a private setup.
* Lab Outcomes (LO): To understand how blockchain systems (mainly Etherum) work. (LO1)

## Task to be performed : 
* To install and set up an Ethereum network to create a private Ethereum blockchain for development and testing purposes. 
* Follow the instructions in this manual to [set up a Private Ethereum Network](https://github.com/LifnaJos/private_ethereum_setup/blob/main/README.md)
1. Choosing a network ID
2. Choosing a consensus Algorithm
3. Creating a Genesis Block
4. Initializing the Geth Database
5. Setting up Networking
6. Running the member nodes
7. Running a Signer (In Clique)

* Note : Download the [genesis file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Xwg1dKp2B3yhfNfSX81h0LDQRCTqWU6/view?usp=drive_link) and edit the account details (ie. Public Keys of the peers in the network)

## Instructions : 
Write the Theory in the following format. Refer to [Go Ethereum](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/fundamentals/private-network#private-networks))
* Significance of a Private Ethereum Network
* Steps for creating a Private Ethereum Network

## Outcome :  
* Understood the relevance of a Private Ethereum Network
* Understood how to set up the Private Ethereum Network

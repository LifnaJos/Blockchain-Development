# Experiment  No - 3	: Study on Solidity Programming for creating Smart Contracts
* Date of Preparation : 3rd week of August 2024
* Date of Submission : * 
* Lab Objectives: To explore Blockchain concepts.
* Lab Outcomes (LO): Design Smart Contract using Solidity (LO2)*
 
## Task to be performed : 
Step - 1 : Hands on Solidity Programming Assignments for creating Smart Contracts
Go to LearnETH Tutorials provided by Remix IDE
Explore through Solidity Beginner Course
Complete all the 19 Assignments provided with the Course
Step - 2 : Deploying a Voting/Ballot Smart Contract
Open  Remix IDE
Under Workspaces, open contracts folder
Open Ballot.sol, contract.
Understand Ballot.sol contract.
Deploy the contract by changing the Proposal name from bytes32 â†’ string

## Tools & Libraries used :  Remix IDE, Ethers 

## Instructions : (Prepare for viva for the following topics)
Primitive Data Types, Variables, Functions - pure, view
Inputs and Outputs to Functions, Visibility, Modifiers and Constructors
Control Flow : if-else, loops
Data Structures : Arrays, Mappings, structs, enums, Data Locations
Transactions : Ether and wei, Gas and Gas Price, Sending Transactions
What is the relevance of require statements in the functions of Solidity Programs?
Understand the keywords mapping, storage and memory
Why bytes32 instead of string?
## Outcome :  
Understood the basics of Solidity Programming in writing Smart Contracts and Deploying them on the Remix VM. Successfully performed the Assignments given in the Tutorial.
Understood the logic of Ballot contract in Solidity and Successfully performed the deployment of the contract.
Prepare a document with Aim, Tasks performed, Program, Output and Conclusion.
Submit the hardcopy  by the 4th week of August 2024
(As per the instructions, submit a hard copy of the same).
